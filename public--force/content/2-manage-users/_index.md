#### Overview
Now that you have a React web app, you will configure an authentication resource for the app using AWS Amplify Auth, powered by Amazon Cognito. Cognito is a powerful user directory service that manages user registration, authentication, account recovery, and more.

You will use the **AWS Management Console** to enable access to **Amazon Bedrock** and **Claude 3 Sonnet** foundation model, which the app will use to generate recipes.
