You will need two Amplify libraries for your project. The main aws-amplify library contains all of the client-side APIs for connecting your app's frontend to your backend, and the @aws-amplify/ui-react library contains framework-specific UI components.
1. Open a new terminal window, navigate to your projects root folder *(ai-recipe-generator)*, and run the following command to install the libraries.
```
npm install aws-amplify @aws-amplify/ui-react
```
